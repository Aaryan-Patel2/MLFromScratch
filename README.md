# Machine Learning from Ground Zero!

This repository contains Python code for implementing Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using only NumPy and basic Python modules. The code examples provided here are inspired by the tutorials created by YouTuber Patrick Loeber.

## Introduction

In order to fully be able to understand the most vital and fundamental concepts of Machine Learning, it is important to understand how the algorithms work under the hood of this complex and diverse car. This repository contains Python code for implementing the following Machine Learning algorithms from scratch:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (along with a regression form of the algorithm)
- Naive Bayes (Later on I am going to be creating code for all the different PMF's that can be used with Naive Bayes like Bernoulli, Multinomial, etc.)

## Pre-requisites

- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn (for the testing portion of the code)
